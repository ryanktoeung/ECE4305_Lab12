**DEMO VIDEO :** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TabSw4L4i0E&feature=youtu.be
* This program allows for the user to use a keyboard as a controller for a chasing LED model.
* When the "p" key is pressed, the system will pause the LED at its current position until another "p" is pressed.
  * This works as a play or pause key
* To change the delay value, the user will press the key "F1" along with a valid 3 digit value IE : 000-999.
  * If this is not inputted correctly, the system will just ignore the input and continue on with the last valid key inputted.
